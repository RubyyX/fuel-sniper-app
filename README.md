# FuelSniper-App
Attempt to create the petrol notification system (https://github.com/RubyyX/PetrolNotification) using Swift UI to create a mobile app for iOS.
This project came to a stand still when faced with challenges including: creating and managing a database hosted on a web service; learning Swift in depth
to bring the UI to life; developing the algorithm for predicting fuel prices using time series analysis as collecting the data required a database.
